## Introduction

A headless CMS is a back-end only content management system that makes content accessible via an API for display on any device. This article will explore what a headless CMS is and when it might be the right choice for your project.

## What is a Headless CMS?

Unlike traditional CMSs, a headless CMS does not handle the front-end presentation layer. Instead, it focuses on content creation and storage, delivering content through APIs to various front-ends.

## Benefits of Headless CMS

1. **Flexibility**: Use any technology stack for the front-end.
2. **Scalability**: Better performance and scalability for high-traffic sites.
3. **Omnichannel**: Deliver content to multiple platforms (web, mobile, IoT, etc.).

## Example Platforms

### Strapi

Strapi is an open-source headless CMS that is highly customizable and developer-friendly.

### Example Code

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/articles')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

### Contentful

Contentful is a cloud-based headless CMS known for its flexibility and powerful API.

```javascript
const client = contentful.createClient({
  space: 'your_space_id',
  accessToken: 'your_access_token'
});

client.getEntries()
  .then(entries => console.log(entries.items));
```

## When to Use a Headless CMS

- **Multiple Platforms**: When you need to deliver content across multiple platforms.
- **Custom Front-End**: When you prefer to build a custom front-end using frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.
- **High Scalability**: When you require a highly scalable and performant solution.
